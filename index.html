<h1>Omaha Dynamic Language Users Group (ODLUG)</h1>

<pre>
Meeting time again! Woot!

Tonight I'll launch the "community dev server" that I mentioned last meeting, and point odlug.org 
at it. I'll present "From Zero to Catalyst" -- how to launch and install a full web stack on the 
linode.com virtual hosting service. 

Catalyst, Perl, Apache, fastcgi, Moose, DBIx::Class, Template Toolkit...

If you're coming to the meeting and want to pitch in a dollar or two a month, email me your 
preferred username and I'll create you an account and grant you sudoers access to blow things 
up and/or install your favorite languages / development environments. Hopefully odlug.org becomes 
a show case for all the tech that people in Omaha love to use.   :)

Should I throw WordPress on it too? I suppose my little company should be blogging useful things. 
Any interest?
