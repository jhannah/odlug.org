Meeting time again! Woot!

Tonight I'll launch the "community dev server" that I mentioned last meeting, and point odlug.org 
at it. I'll present "From Zero to Catalyst" -- how to launch and install a full web stack on the 
linode.com virtual hosting service. 

Catalyst, Perl, Apache, fastcgi, Moose, DBIx::Class, Template Toolkit...

If you're coming to the meeting and want to pitch in a dollar or two a month, email me your 
preferred username and I'll create you an account and grant you sudoers access to blow things 
up and/or install your favorite languages / development environments. Hopefully odlug.org becomes 
a show case for all the tech that people in Omaha love to use.   :)

Should I throw WordPress on it too? I suppose my little company should be blogging useful things. 
Any interest?

http://odlug.org   (Mediawiki until sometime tonight   -grin-)

<h2>About this server...</h2>
This site is hosted on our "community development server." (Debian 5.0 Linux on linode.com.)
<b>You</b> are invited to join us. 
Anyone who attends one of our meetings can have an account and sudo access to the machine. 
We hope that over time odlug.org becomes a showcase for the various tech people in Omaha love to use.
Don't do anything illegal or spammy or heavy load (network or storage) and you can use this server 
for whatever you want (other low volume hobby sites, whatever). Keep in mind the server could explode
at any time. Don't leave your valuables lying around or feel entitled to uptime. 
The server reserves the right to permanently blink out of existence at any time without notice.
It probably won't, but don't count on it.
This entire site <a href="http://github.com/jhannah/odlug">is in github</a>. If you're not already
a collaborator in that repo, or have questions / comments / concerns about this server,
