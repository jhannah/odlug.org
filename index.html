<h2>About this server...</h2>
This site is hosted on our "community development server." (Debian 5.0 Linux on linode.com.)
Join us! We grant accounts and sudo access to people who attend our meetings.
We hope that over time odlug.org becomes a showcase for the various tech people in Omaha are
passionate about. 
Don't do anything illegal or spammy or heavy load (network or storage) and you can use this server 
for whatever you want (other low volume hobby sites, whatever). Keep in mind the server could explode
at any time. Don't leave your valuables lying around or feel entitled to uptime. 
The server reserves the right to permanently blink out of existence at any time without notice.
It probably won't, but don't count on it.
This entire site <a href="http://github.com/jhannah/odlug">is in github</a>. If you're not already
a collaborator in that repo, or have questions / comments / concerns about this server, 
join our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/odynug">mailing list</a> and/or ping us
<a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=omaha.dev">in IRC</a>.
