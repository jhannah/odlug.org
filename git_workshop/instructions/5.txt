Task 5 - A branch
-----------

Everyone will create a topic branch for task 5.

Task 5 is this: Make a directory in work/ of your name, and stick a README file
in there. But don't do this in 'master', do it in a new topic/yourname branch. 

e.g.:
   git checkout -b topic/jhannah
   mkdir jhannah
   touch jhannah/README
   git add jhannah
   git commit -a -m "oh ya, I'm a branching fiend!"
   git push
