Everyone should work in the /work directory. 

(
   instructions/ is where each task is described. This directory should
       not be modified during the workshop.
   
   admin_only/ has "checkpoint" files that the people running the workshop
       might find handy if everything goes terribly wrong.
)

-----------   
Task 1
-----------

Create a file using your name in the root of /work. e.g.:

   touch hello.jhannah
   git add hello.jhannah
   git commit -m "task 1 complete! woot!"
   git push
