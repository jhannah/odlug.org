-----------   
Task 3 - Conflicts!
-----------

In pairs of 2, workers wil be assigned one line of the file work/2.txt to modify.
You will add your name to the end of the line. This should cause lots of conflicts
as each line of the file will be changed by two people simultaneously.

e.g.  If you are assigned row 'c', you would change this line:

  cccccccccccccccjayccccccccccccc

to this:

  ccccccccccccjayccccccccccccccccjayhannah

e.g.:
   vi 2.txt
   git add 2.txt
   git commit -m "task 3 complete! woot!"
   git push
