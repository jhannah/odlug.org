-----------   
Task 3 - Everyone changes a single file
-----------

Each worker will be assigned one line of the file work/3.txt to
modify. Stick your name in the middle of your assigned letter.

e.g.  If you are assigned row 'c', you would change this line:

  ccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc

to this:

  ccccccccccccjaycccccccccccccccc

e.g.:
   vi 2.txt
   git commit -a -m "task 2 complete! woot!"
   git push

We used -a here (commit "all"), which is handy sometimes.
