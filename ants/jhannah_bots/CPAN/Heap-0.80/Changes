0.70  Fri Dec  5 00:55:41 EST 2003
	- finally got around to renaming minimum and
	  extract_minimum methods to top and extract_top

	  - old names are still supported, but depracated

0.71  Thu Jun 17 12:25:36 EDT 2004
	- fixed a memory leak in Heap::Fibonacci
	  - the DESTROY method did'nt traverse fully
	- one final reference to extract_minimum in doc for Heap.pm
	- both issues reported by Christian Plessl <plessl@tik.ee.ethz.ch>

0.72  Fri Jul  8 09:05:04 CET 2005 (Tels)
	- moved file to lib/ and t/ to remove clutter and simplify build
	- rewrite most test files to use Test::More
	- change test files to load this version, not currently installed one
	- added tests for the various other .pm files
	- removed unnec. require Autoloader and comments about autoloading
	- remove "perl extension" from ABSTRACTs
	- Heap::Elem gets proper heap() and val() routines, the
	  other subclasses (Heap::Elem::Num etc) now simple inherit them

	- accepted (finally) all of the changes submitted by Tels++

	  by Tels++)
