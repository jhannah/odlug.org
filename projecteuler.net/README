Project Euler - Lots of mathy/programming puzzles!  :)

Each directory is for ODLUG solutions to a problem #. 

   1/   http://projecteuler.net/problem=1 
        "Add all the natural numbers below one thousand that are multiples 
        of 3 or 5."

   2/   http://projecteuler.net/problem=2
        "By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do 
        not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms."

   etc...
