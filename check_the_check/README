Your task is to write a program that reads a chessboard configuration and identifies
whether a king in under attack (in check). A king is in check if it is on a square which
can be taken by the opponent on his next move.

White pieces will be represented by uppercase letters, and black pieces by lowercase
letters. The white side will always be on the bottom of the board, with the black side
always on the top.
